Literally hundreds of impressionable young starlets got drunkenly deflowered against their will on the hood of this beauty and then later ended up with a face through the windshield. $1 million buys you more than just a used car without power steering – it buys you a piece of history. The interior still reeks of bourbon and cigarettes.

You could scarcely cross the street without getting mown down by a soccer mom or drug dealer in one of these during the early 2000s. The glory days of the excessively-large, gas-guzzling SUV might be over, but the Cavalcade still takes no prisoners. This is the latest model, featuring redesigned bumpers and new LED lights.
The aggressive styling and hyper tuned engine make this a bike that's ready for a fight. Most likely it'll be fighting the back of a truck or a highway barrier, but that'll be down to you.<br><br>Features KERS Kinetic energy recovery system, which uses the bike's axle power to generate energy for the hyper cell battery. This power can be delivered to the back wheel via a direct drive brushless motor, giving the bike a hi torque speed boost.
