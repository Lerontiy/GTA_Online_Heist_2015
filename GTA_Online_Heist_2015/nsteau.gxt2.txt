~z~You're bogarting that pipe.

~z~Don't rush it. Whatever you do, do not rush it.
~z~Do not move on the vans 'til you got all the guards,
~z~Alright, kids. You're making a pass at the Lost out near my place by the Alamo Sea.

~z~Lemme in, man. I'm fiending.
~z~Clean 'em up. Let's do this.
SFX_PAUSE_350
~z~I hope you're making 'em suffer. You know, suffer silently.
~z~I've told Ron you're coming, so you better get there,

~z~And be careful of the vans! The dolls you got back there are fragile.
~z~How you doing? When you're close, get out the boat, and creep up on them.
~z~The plan is to go in when most of them are sleeping, you take out the guards, and take the vans.
~z~And that lady played the same game as you do.
