~z~The prison bus is set to move.

~z~Looks like you're clear.
~z~Sure, we could do that, but it'd cost money. And this is costing us...
~z~The locals are watching the roads. Take the bus onto the dirt, and you'll have more chance of losing 'em.
~z~Amazing what they can fit up there. The lifers especially.

~z~The bad news is that means there's an armed security detail.

~z~It's on the road from the prison to Paleto, and I'm here if you need me.

~z~How's the bus?
~z~So you're hitting the transport, and you're not second guessing us again.

~z~They're holding a grade X inmate classed national security risk.

~z~I know what you're thinking. You're thinking it'd be easier to take an old school bus, paint it,

~z~You see that chopper tailing the bus? Local law enforcement are gonna keep on coming unless you down it.

~z~and people go, "Where was he keeping that? It's so unrealistic"?

~z~Okay, it's time to "catch" the bus. You can have that.
~z~Okay. Looks like things are heating up.

~z~No one hiding in the back with a cell phone, a carton of cigarettes, a pint of pruno up his ass?

~z~I say to them, "you've clearly not spent much time in the US prison system".
PBB_AFAA
~z~bar the windows, and make it smell like blood, bowels, and your brother's high school tube sock.
~z~Bring the transport to the junkyard outside Sandy Shores.
~z~and they'll be distracted from what's really going on. You read me?

~z~You missed the window. Transport's outta range.
PBB_AFAB
~z~Okay, so we need the bus intact.

~z~Everyone thinks it's a breakout gone wrong, they're looking in the wrong place.
~z~Levity and pop culture references are useful tools when trying to gain the trust of new associates.
